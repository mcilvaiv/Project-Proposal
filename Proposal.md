# R Project Proposal
Valerie McIlvaine and Jake Bedi
## Introduction

In our final project, we will investigate superbowl ads from 2000 to 2020 using a data set from Five Thirty Eight. We will make a website or application that displays trends of brands’ advertisement strategies over time and use predictive modeling/ simulations to anticipate which direction superbowl ads will go in the future.

## Analysis   
We will find an additional data set and/or create one on our own adding additional attributes to the ads. We will attempt to find correlations between ad categories(funny, did it include animals, cost, length of advertisement, etc.) as well as employ data filtering, regression, and visualization methods.
Using a data visualization package that we have not learned about in class (maybe Rayshader), we will create more unique and interactive plots.

## Why does it matter/ What’s the problem?
Every year, millions of people watch the super bowl and its infamous ads. But how have the ads changed over the past 20 years? Have the ads gotten funnier  or used more sex appeal? How do the strategies of beer brands compare to those of car companies?
 
## Why are we interested in this topic?
The Superbowl has been one of America’s top watched games since the creation of the NFL. Vast majority of kids in the states grow up idolizing a player in the NFL - so they love watching the game. It's been instilled in us since we were kids! Now that we are a bit older, watching the Superbowl is not just for the game.. The ads are highly talked about and just enjoyable to watch! So we decided to take on this project to find some interesting correlations between advertisements over the years.
